## Task Description

The goal of the task is to create a react web application that will display all the information about the Rick and Morty Tv series. It Should have 4 tabs in the navigation panel: Characters, Episodes, Locations, My watch list.

### 1) 
The 	Characters page should have a list of all characters that are in the tv series (Implement pagination for that. So that there are 	10-character cards per page). The list should have a filter by 	“species”, “status”, “gender” fields. The character card should have a character picture (if any), and some additional info about that character (your choice). When you click on the character card – the popup should be opened where will be all character info.

### 2) 
The episode page should be really similar to the character page, the episodes should have filtered by “name” field (if you will have inspiration please add other filters). Make this a table, also there should be 25 episodes per page(pagination). 	

### 3)
The Locations page should also be a table with pagination and should have filtered by “name”, “type”, “dimension” field.
 	
### 4) 
My watch list should have a simple to do like functional there should be an input field where user can write down a new episode to watch later. Use local storage to store the To Do items. The toDo list item should have a remove button to remove it from the list and the checkbox to mark it as complete(when the page has reloaded the status of the task and the list should not change).
